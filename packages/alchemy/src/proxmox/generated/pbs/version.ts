/**
 * Generated proxmox-backup-server API types for `/version` — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
 *
 * Run: bun codegen/types.ts    (`--check` compares without writing)
 * Manifest entry: `pbs-apidoc` — proxmox-backup-server 4.2.6-1 (running 4.2.3)
 *   sha256 274ab9f6fc075aea, read on a PBS host from
 *   /usr/share/doc/proxmox-backup/html/api-viewer/apidoc.js
 *
 * ⚠️ A REQUEST PARAMETER IS TEXT ON THE WIRE. `client.ts` sends form encoding, so an integer is
 *   `\`${number}\`` and a boolean is `'0' | '1'` — the spellings that reach the server. The
 *   vendor's BOUNDS on those values are enforced separately, at plan time, from
 *   pbs/../constraints (codegen/README.md). A response is JSON and is not spelled that way.
